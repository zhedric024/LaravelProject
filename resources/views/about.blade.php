        <h1>COVID-19 PREVENTION</h1>
        <br><p>Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to suppress transmission and save lives; the use of a mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection against COVID-19.</p>
        <br><p>If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!</p>
        <br><p>Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal of masks are essential to make them as effective as possible.</p>
        <br><p>Here are the basics of how to wear a mask:</p>
        <br><p>1. Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.</p>
        <br><p>2. Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin. </p>
        <br> <p>3. When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.</p>
        <br><p>4. Don’t use masks with valves.</p>
